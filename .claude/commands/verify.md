# /verify

Tiered Zig 0.16 quality gate. Four tiers, each runs the tier below it first.

Runtime: TypeScript under Bun. Authoritative entrypoints are
`scripts/verify-{fast,commit,pr,release}.ts`. The matching `.sh` files
are thin compatibility shims (`exec bun "$ROOT/scripts/<name>.ts" "$@"`)
kept for callers that hardcode the legacy names. Per the repo language
rule, do not add new bash logic to these gates — extend the TS modules.

| Tier | Budget | What it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` (default) | <2s | `zig fmt --check` + `zig ast-check` (+ optional `ziglint`) |
| `commit` | ~30s | fast + `zig build test --test-timeout 30s` + public-API drift check |
| `pr` | ~10min | commit + cross-target matrix + safety-mode rotation + bounded fuzz |
| `release` | hours | pr + clean non-incremental rebuild + reproducibility check + deep fuzz + SBOM + cosign sign |

## Contract

- TS entrypoints live at `scripts/verify-{fast,commit,pr,release}.ts`,
  invoked via `bun`. Bash shims at the same names without the extension
  exist only for legacy compat.
- Each entry exits 0 on success, non-zero on any failure. First failure
  halts the chain.
- A project without the scripts is not toolkit-ready — copy the
  `zig-qm-toolkit` chezmoi template before invoking `/verify`.

## Steps

1. Parse $ARGUMENTS:
   - Empty or `fast` → run `bun scripts/verify-fast.ts`
   - `commit` → `bun scripts/verify-commit.ts`
   - `pr` → `bun scripts/verify-pr.ts`
   - `release` → `bun scripts/verify-release.ts`
   - Anything else → **refuse** with: "Unknown tier '<arg>'. Valid tiers: fast, commit, pr, release." Do NOT silently fall back to fast.
2. Execute via Bash tool and stream output. The legacy `./scripts/<name>.sh`
   shim is also acceptable when a caller's allowlist is shim-only.
3. On non-zero exit, summarize what failed (which tier, which step, top 10 lines of stderr) and stop — do not proceed to higher tiers.
4. On success, report the tier that ran, wall-clock time, and what the next higher tier would additionally cover.

## When to use which tier

- **Per edit (PostToolUse hook covers this automatically):** hooks already run the fmt/ast-check equivalents. `/verify fast` is rarely needed manually.
- **Before committing:** `/verify commit`.
- **Before `gt submit` or `gh pr create`:** `/verify pr`.
- **Before tagging a release:** `/verify release`.

## Notes

- All timings are indicative. Cross-target builds dominate `pr` time; fuzz dominates `release`.
- `pr` and `release` require `zig build fuzz` step in `build.zig`; if absent, fuzz is skipped with a notice.
- `release` requires `cosign` and optionally `cyclonedx-cli` — install via nix-darwin if you intend to publish signed artifacts.
